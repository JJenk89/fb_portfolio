## My process

I first conducted a technical interview with the client in order to determine their wishes in terms of design, features and functionality of the site.

Designs were made in collaboration with the client and were then implemented into a mobile design.

All of these features, layouts and wishes were made into a checklist and worked through.

Finally, tablet, laptop and desktop designs were created and implemented with approval of the client at all stages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript (No frameworks)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I feel I have learnt how to apply a lot of frontend web development principles into a working product for this client.

The site is fully functional on mobiles, tablets, laptops and desktops.

Accessibility was taken into consideration and applied where necessary.

All the code was done in vanilla JavaScript and helped solidify many basic principles of programming.

This was also a chance to implement some SEO techniques in order to boost the visibility of the client's site.

### Continued development

I'll be tackling a fullstack project in the future in order to work on some backend development and further expand my skills to become a more well-rounded developer.
